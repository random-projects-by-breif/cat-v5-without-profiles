She enters the familiar magical world and lets out a sigh of frustration. The Spirit Owl perched on Evelynn’s shoulder disappears, hinting to her that Whisper has left his meditative state and is probably stomping on his way to confront her.\n    Evelynn sits under an enormous glowing tree to enjoy the calm before the storm. She observes the realm while she waits. She can hear a peaceful hum ringing while it ​​encompasses her soul with peace.\n    The peace turns to irritation as Evelynn spots Whisper in the distance. She knows an argument is coming her way, as it always is with Whisper. She isn’t particularly in the mood for a squabble.\n    “You did not follow our plan,” states Whisper as he walks towards her.\n    “Let’s not have this argument again. I did what I saw fit in the situation,” Evelynn counters back.\n    Whisper sighs in disappointment as he continues, “You always use that excuse. You could have been injured; we were outnumbered.”\n    Evelynn rolls her eyes, “We? You don’t know what it’s like to be in combat!”\n    Whisper’s eyes flash with pain. Evelynn’s guts twist in guilt as she speaks again, “Look, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean it to come out the way…”\n    Before Evelynn could finish her sentence, Whisper speaks, “I may not be there physically, but I am always looking out for you.”\n    Suddenly, the world is engulfed in brightness as an ominous streak of light spontaneously appears, tearing through the fabric of the realm. Giant hideous creatures enter and start ravaging the serene landscape. Loud screeches from the spirits start echoing.\n    Evelynn and Whisper are stunned as hoards of spirits run toward the portal. Within the chaos, the pair spot Catherine running towards them.\n    “They’re trying to capture the spirits. We need to evacuate now!” Catherine rambles as she pants heavily.\n    “Where are the others?” questions Evelynn.\n    “Containing the invasion,” Catherine responds.\n    Evelynn nods and teleports next to the portal as she tries to open it. “It’s stuck!” she yells.\n    “I think I have an idea,” Whisper says as he assumes his meditative state.\n    The portal starts slowly opening, and the spirits rush out of it. “I won’t be able to hold it for long,” Whisper mumbles through gritted teeth.\n    Catherine and Evelynn start guiding the spirits out. In the distance, the combat gets louder. Evelynn observes that Ignis and Aery are struggling to keep the creatures at bay.\n    “Can you take care of this? I am going to help the others,” commands Evelynn as Catherine nods in response.\n    Evelynn quickly teleports to join the front line and realizes how outnumbered they are. “We should fall back and make our way to the portal!” she exclaims.\n    The group carefully starts falling back. Evelynn turns around and notices that the spirits are evacuated as the three guardians halt, surrounding Whisper in a protective stance.\n    Whisper states, “You guys should make a run for the portal. I can’t hold it open any longer.”\n    Evelynn urges, “Go, go. I won’t leave without Whisper.”\n    Ignis and Aery start running. Whisper scrunches his eyes as he speaks again, “You need to leave!”\n    “Didn’t you hear me? I am not leaving without you. We are partners,” Evelynn states as she uses her daggers to protect Whisper from the creatures.\n    Whisper lets out a painful sigh, “Evelynn, please. You have to trust me. They need you now more than ever.”\n    Desperate, Evelynn speaks, “Promise me that you’ll be okay.”\n    “I promise,” he responds with a forced smile.\n    Evelynn nods at Whisper and runs through the shimmering veil as it slowly starts closing. Once on the other side, she looks back at Whisper, who is trying to escape the creatures.\n    A teardrop falls from Evelynn’s eye as the portal swirls shut.","subtitle":"A Lovers' Quarrel","author":"Grishma","storyTitle":"Spiritual Dilemma"},"gamepassId":72590411,"kitClass":0,"renderImage":"rbxassetid://10406002412"},"spirit_summoner":{"description":"Summon creatures from the spirit world to assist you in combat, healing, and resource collecting!","bedCoinProduct":{"bedCoinProductId":47},"difficulty":2,"priceRobux":399,"name":"Uma","abilities":[{"innate":true,"abilityId":"change_spirit_affinity"},{"innate":true,"abilityId":"summon_attack_spirit"},{"innate":true,"abilityId":"summon_heal_spirit"}],"gamepassId":1004557543,"kitItems":[{"featuredInKitSelection":true,"innateItem":{"amount":1},"itemType":"spirit_staff","removeWhenDeactivatingKit":true},{"itemType":"summon_stone","featuredInKitSelection":true,"loadoutinfo":{"reoccuringTimeSeconds":20},"innateItem":{"firstSpawnOnly":true,"amount":1},"removeWhenDeactivatingKit":true}],"kitClass":7,"renderImage":"rbxassetid://95760990786863"},"scarab":{"description":"Places Scarab Hives that periodically spawns scarabs to seek out and attack nearby enemies and beds.","bedCoinProduct":{"bedCoinProductId":56},"difficulty":2,"priceRobux":479,"name":"Abaddon","kitItems":[{"itemType":"scarab_spawner","featuredInKitSelection":true,"loadoutinfo":{"reoccuringTimeSeconds":20},"innateItem":{"firstSpawnOnly":true,"amount":1},"removeWhenDeactivatingKit":true}],"abilities":[{"abilityId":"place_scarab_hive"}],"devProductId":3318569108,"kitClass":0,"renderImage":"rbxassetid://137137517627492"},"airbender":{"description":"Create sandstorms to control the battlefield, move enemies, and protect allies.","bedCoinProduct":{"bedCoinProductId":53},"difficulty":2,"priceRobux":479,"name":"Ramil","abilities":[{"innate":true,"abilityId":"airbender_tornado"},{"innate":true,"abilityId":"airbender_moving_tornado"}],"devProductId":3269024513,"kitClass":0,"renderImage":"rbxassetid://74712750354593"},"necromancer":{"description":"Claim souls to build your undead army!

Trixie and Evelynn huff and puff as they trek through the hills in high winds and relentless raindrops. More iridescent portals appear in the sky as hordes of void creatures spill through them. Evelynn and Trixie hide under the vegetation, stealthily making their way.\n\tPeculiar plants adorn the landscape, beautiful yet otherworldly. Almost all the fauna are bioluminescent, dimly lighting the environment. Although the sky is pitch black, ripples of purple light emit through the dark storm clouds.\n\tIn the distance, Trixie notices a blazing glow. She points it out to Evelynn and whispers, “Look, there! Is that it?”\n    Evelynn whispers, “Yes, I’ve always wondered what the source would be like.” She looks at Trixie, notices her pale face, and asks, “Are you okay?”\n\tTrixie nods, questioning, “Uh-huh, why wouldn’t I be?”\n    Evelynn responds, “You look nervous. Are you sure you’re up for this?”\n    Evelynn notices Trixie visibly gulps as she waves her shaky hand. “Yeah, I got it. I can do this!” Trixie counters back, almost trying to convince herself.\n\tSuddenly, Evelynn stops in her tracks, and Trixie, still engrossed in her thoughts, bumps into Evelynn’s back.\n    “We are here,” Evelynn announces.\n    Trixie peaks from behind, as the warmth of the flower gently kisses her skin. Perched on top of a rock, the flower is surrounded by strange, enormous statues.\n    Mesmerised by its beauty, Trixie doesn’t notice when Evelynn scans their surroundings for any threat before quickly climbing the rock on which the flower is perched.\n    “Are you coming?” Evelynn waves at Trixie.\n    Trixie follows timidly and comes face to face with the flower. “It’s beautiful!” She exclaims breathlessly as her eyes sparkle in the radiant bloom. The warmth of the flower spreads with a tingling sensation through her body.\n    “You ready?” Evelynn questions.\n    Trixie nods. She reaches out to touch the flower. Instantly, an ethereal energy flows through her as her feet lift off the ground.\n\t“I think it’s working,” Trixie excitedly observes. The wind surrounding her intensifies, circling her as she floats even higher.\n\tA loud rustling sound is heard. “Something is here,” warns Evelynn as she quickly gets down from the rock. Void Knight jumps out of the bushes, catching her off guard. Evelynn manages to block his attack at the last moment.\n\tVoid Knight lets out a loud groan of frustration as he increases the intensity of his attacks. Evelynn starts to struggle; all she can do is defend herself. Desperation leaks out of her voice as she screams at Trixie, “Hurry up!”\n\tEntranced, Trixie doesn’t respond, but Evelynn notices fewer portals in the sky. A sense of relief washes through Evelynn’s face, but the moment is short-lived. Two void creatures emerge from the bush cover, running towards Trixie.\n    Overwhelmed, Evelynn quickly throws her daggers, hitting one of the creatures right between its eyes, while the other is sliced at the ankle. Both the creatures slump to the ground, with one still slowly crawling toward Trixie.\n    As Evelynn is distracted, Void Knight takes a swing, and his sword slashes through Evelynn’s abdomen. She stumbles back, wincing in pain as she grasps onto the wound.\n    The last of the portals disappears. Trixie slowly opens her eyes, which glow with an otherworldly spark. She is still floating and emitting a flaming light like a star.\n    Void Knight screams in rage as more of the void creatures approach the girls. Trixie raises her hand, and a portal appears below the crawling creature in front of her, swallowing it. She turns to look at the horde running towards Evelynn, and this time, without even needing to raise a finger, Trixie conjures a portal right below the creatures as they fall through it and disappear.\n    Void Knight watches the scene in front of him in horror. As a last hurrah, he rushes towards Trixie, hoping to catch her off guard. Trixie smirks and says, “Try me.”\n    She stands still as Void Knight’s sword is about to make contact with her, but at the very last moment, she disappears and reappears behind him. Stunted, Void Knight turns around to swing his sword again as a portal opens below his feet. He screams in anguish as he falls into it.\n    Trixie’s eyes finally stop glowing as her feet touch the ground again. She rushes in to help Evelynn.\n    “You did it, kid,” Evelynn says, and she pats Trixie’s shoulder. Trixie gives her a toothy smile and responds, “Let’s get you home to Whisper, eh?”","subtitle":"The Heart of the Spirit Realm","author":"Grishma","storyTitle":"Spirit Blossom"},"gamepassId":1105395958,"abilities":[{"innate":true,"abilityId":"void_walker_warp"},{"innate":false,"abilityId":"void_walker_rewind"}],"kitClass":0,"renderImage":"rbxassetid://78915127961078"},"shielder":{"description":"Spawn with a massive shield.

In front of us are piles of paper indicating the financial losses endured by the guild’s various businesses. I shift in my seat, uncomfortable from the stress radiating from every direction. The somber mood of the room is multiplied by the absence of natural light and the room's dark, depressing decor. It has been two weeks, three days, and 13 hours since we have been held here, waiting to be free.\n    Most of the guild’s operations are on pause due to the king’s decision to place a strict curfew on citizens and a ban on alchemy throughout the Kingdom. To maintain these new laws, the King has also increased the presence of Royal Guards around the city, especially around the cave and the crystal storage room. Although the rumors of the King’s paranoia are speculative, his suspicion regarding the theft of the crystals is true. The guild uses these crystals not only to amplify magic but also as a source of fuel for advanced machinery. The crystals can take a mediocre alchemist and turn him into a God. \n\tA senior guild member, Nazar, the Queenpin’s favorite soldier, is trusted to get past these restrictions and acquire the crystals. His expertise is monitoring and managing all the city's criminal activities and the guild’s lower-ranking members. On the other hand, I am responsible for the guild’s trading ventures and maintaining business relationships with other criminal syndicates around the continent. However, my talents have not gained me the favor of the Queenpin, as has Nazar’s.\n    The restriction on trading put forth by the King has partially crippled my operations enough to cause significant losses. My clientele has also been growing impatient as I have been unable to fulfill orders without being caught by the guards. In a desperate move, I contacted one of my clients, hoping their vested interest in the Kingdom’s resources might work in the guild’s favor.      \n\tThe room suddenly goes quiet as Death Adder, our leader, walks in and takes her seat. “What’s the progress?” She speaks in a cold, chilling voice that sends shivers down my spine. I look towards Nazar and notice his frown lines deepen.\n    He gets up from his seat and clears his throat. His voice quivers, “In the last two weeks, we have attempted to raid the cave and storage area more than a dozen times.”\n    “And?” the Queenpin impatiently asks.\n    Nazar hesitantly continues, “They’ve been monitoring our every move. It has been impossible to shake them off.”\n    Silence.\n    The Queenpin turns to look at Nazar, and her eyes start glowing bright purple as she asks, “So, you have failed?”\n    Nazar takes a step back as the stench of fear fills the room.\n    Adder gets up from her seat, and purple mist floats around her hands. Nazar takes another step back as he stumbles on the chair behind him.\n    ‘How the mighty have fallen?’ I think to myself, and as much entertaining as it is to watch Nazar squirm for longer, I realize this is my opportunity to seize the moment.\n    “If I may?” I ask the Queenpin, disrupting her concentration on her mana. She looks at me, nods in acknowledgment, and sits back on her chair.\n    I walk closer and place my ledger in front of her. The book details the fiscal losses the trade has faced since the ban and our clientele list.\n    “Are you trying to rub our failures in my face, Wren?” Death Adder asks.\n    Treading lightly, I responded, “No, in fact, I think I have a solution. As you can see, our biggest client for the past couple of years has been the Pirate Queen.”\n    “And?” she exclaims.\n    “She has shown interest in helping us raid the storage area,” I explain as I pass her the letter discussing the offer.\n    I continue, “The pirates have the numbers to distract the guards while we help secure the crystals. The King may suspect us, but he is not expecting an invasion from the outside.”\n    Death Adder chuckles and asks, “What does Pirate Queen gain in return?”\n    “Double the share of the crystals promised to her in trade,” I respond while pointing it out on the letter, hoping the demand isn’t too high for Adder's taste.\n    “An unlikely ally with a very high price,” She pauses and looks at me, “But who is to say she won’t betray us?”\n    I clear my throat, “I believe that the pirates have found a way to use the crystals to fuel their ships. The crystal's magic allows the ships to fly; lucky for us, our island is the only place one can find these. I also believe that she has a personal grudge against the King, although my sources could not confirm the origin of her resentment.”\n    I bite my lip impatiently, waiting for Adder to respond, who seems to be inspecting the letter with a keen eye.\n    “Interesting. Find out what this feud is. We just may find something to turn the tide in our favor, and in the meantime, Nazar, see to it that Wren has everything he needs to execute this plan,” she proclaims as she gets up and walks towards the door.\n    I sigh at the sight, but my relief is short-lived as Adder turns around to look at me with her glowing eyes. My heart sinks as she speaks, “Oh, and well done, Wren! Just make sure not to disappoint me. I do not like to fail; in fact, I despise it.”\n    I nod in response as my throat starts to dry up. Adder walks out of the room, slamming the door behind her. My being fills up with relief and dread at the same time. I fall back onto my seat, trying to control my breathing.\n    Slowly but surely, the thick cloud of despair in the room lifts. I look towards Nazar, who sighs deeply before questioning, “So, how do you want to go about this?”","author":"Grishma","backgroundImage":"rbxassetid://101546011466562","disableKitImage":true},"gamepassId":893911891,"abilities":[{"innate":true,"abilityId":"open_black_market"},{"abilityId":"close_black_market"}],"kitClass":5,"renderImage":"rbxassetid://18922642482"},"rebellion_leader":{"description":"The leader of the citizens’ rebellion, who encourages and buffs his allies with healing and damage auras!","bedCoinProduct":{"bedCoinProductId":36},"difficulty":2,"priceRobux":399,"name":"Silas","abilities":[{"abilityId":"rebellion_aura_swap"},{"abilityId":"rebellion_shield"}],"lore":{"subtitle":"Last Stand","storyTitle":"The Weight of Honor","story":"    Dragging his feet on the dirt road, Silas walks home from the Royal Guard’s command office located in the castle's west wing. Frown lines adorn his forehead as beads of sweat glint in the harsh sun. He reaches to touch his sword, a habit of comfort, but his hand grazes over the empty sheath. Silas looks down at his waist belt and sighs.\n\tThe seed of doubt regarding his decision to quit starts to creep into his mind like a persistent weed in a well-tended garden. He shakes his head in an attempt to eliminate the doubt. Silas has never been a quitter. He served his nation on the battlefield before serving his king in the capital. He is a celebrated knight adorned with medals for his bravery. Silas has known only a life of service, but recent political unrest has forced him to reevaluate his moral position.\n\tSilas is zapped out of his plight when something bumps into his legs. Startled by the impact, He looks down and finds a young boy dressed in rags holding onto a small piece of bread.\n\tSilas bends down to the youngling’s level and asks, “Are you okay?” Behind the kid, he notices a red-faced, middle-aged man dressed in a dirty apron marching towards them.\n    “Oh, thank God, Officer Blackwater, you caught him. This filth was trying to steal from me,” the man exclaims.\n\tThe kid tries to take off, but the Baker quickly grabs his collar and drags him back. Shakily, the kid mumbles, “I am so sorry,” as he tries to free his collar from Baker's grip. Stunned, Silas gets up.\n    “You’re not going anywhere,” Baker declares. He looks at Silas and asks, “Are you not going to arrest him?”\n    Silas looks at the boy, who looks no older than thirteen and has a thin, almost skeletal frame. Dirt caked all over the kid’s face and bare feet.\n    “You want me to arrest him for that?” Silas points at the small piece of bread in the boy's hand as he tries to reason with the angry baker, who scoffs before responding, “The people are starving. Haven’t these guild rats taken enough from us?”\n    The commotion has slowly started to attract a small crowd of anti-guild supporters. A random voice shouts, “Arrest him!” as a few others chime in, angry and ready to claim justice.\n    Silas is overwhelmed by the situation because he lacks the authority he once had. Another group gathers in the support of the boy. Tension rises as the two groups start throwing insults at each other.\n    Further down the street, a couple of guards notice the crowd and start walking towards them. Panic sets in as Silas scrambles to get the crowd’s attention.\n    “Hey! Hey! My name is Silas Blackwater. As many of you know, I served in the Royal Guard for over a decade,” he shouts to get the crowd’s attention.\n    He keeps the volume of his voice up, continuing, “I know things have been hard in the last couple of weeks, with the trade ban affecting our business and causing a food shortage. The guild is to blame for their role in this disaster, but so is our king for not anticipating what a ban like this could do to his citizens.” The crowd seems to have settled down.\n    “The guild and the king have been using us as pawns in their power struggle, claiming that their actions are for our well-being, but instead, they have pitted us against each other while we all starve,” Silas exhales.\n    The guards seem to be getting closer and closer. Silas takes a deep breath to calm his nerves before he speaks again, “This boy here is just a child, a victim like the rest of us. All he is trying to do is survive, and yes, what he did is wrong, but he is not to blame for the poverty that has plagued our city for so long. He is not to blame for the rampant crime that this poverty has brought with it and those who take advantage of our desperate needs.”\n    Silas’s eyes search the crowd in the hope of seeing expressions of agreement as he continues to rally the crowd, “Now is the time! Now is the time for us to stand up for ourselves. To leave our grievances behind, and focus on our mutual goal of securing a better future for ourselves and our future generations. We must stand up! Stand up together!”\n    The crowd start cheering and chatting with Silas’s name. The doubt that afflicted his mind vanishes. Silas looks towards the boy, who smiles at him with tears brimming in his eyes. Silas tries to open his mouth to say something, but the guards have now circled him.\n    He does not protest; he willingly lets them put him in handcuffs. The crowd starts to protest. Silas tries to scream at the crowd to calm them down, but his voice seems to fall on deaf ears. More guards have already been summoned. They push the crowd out of the way and drag Silas away.","author":"Grishma","backgroundImage":"rbxassetid://133851147493884","disableKitImage":true},"gamepassId":893892894,"kitClass":6,"renderImage":"rbxassetid://18926409564"},"oil_man":{"difficulty":2,"kitClass":7,"name":"Jack","renderImage":"rbxassetid://9166206259","unlockedInBattlePass":true,"kitItems":[{"featuredInKitSelection":true,"previewOnLobbyDisplayModel":true,"itemType":"oil_consumable","removeWhenDeactivatingKit":true}],"battlepassSeason":"season2","description":"Lob bundles of poisonous pumpkin oil across the map."},"axolotl":{"description":"Use your pet axolotls to empower yourself and nearby teammates with shields, increased attack damage, faster break speed, and health regen.","bedCoinProduct":{"bedCoinProductId":16},"difficulty":1,"priceRobux":399,"name":"Axolotl Amy","renderImage":"rbxassetid://9155466713","kitItems":[{"itemType":"damage_axolotl"},{"itemType":"shield_axolotl"},{"itemType":"break_speed_axolotl"},{"itemType":"health_regen_axolotl"}],"kitClass":6,"gamepassId":24393543},"jellyfish":{"description":"Deploy jellyfish and electrify them with your Electric Pulse ability, causing them to zap nearby enemies.

He groans as he can feel his head throb painfully. The constant cheering of the crowd from above doesn't seem to help either. Barbarian waits for the guards to be gone, and then, slowly but agonizingly, he stands up and walks towards his cell door.\n    He observes the other unfortunate souls trapped inside the vast dungeon. He can barely tell the details of their faces as there is no natural light, just a couple of lamps in the corridor between the cages. Barbarian can only see the glimmer in the eyes of the prisoners; some shine with fear, while others seem to carry a fiery rage.\n    A sweet, high-pitched voice speaks up, and Barbarian can tell it’s coming from the cell next to his. “You seem new!” the voice exclaims.\n    Through the iron bars that separate their cells, he tries to make out the details of the person’s appearance. He can only notice luminescent eyes and a tuft of white hair in the dark.\n    Barbarian only grunts in response as he is clearly not in the mood for a conversation. He lays down on the little cot in the corner of his cell. The room is mostly empty, apart from the cot, a toilet, and a small sink with an even smaller broken mirror.\n    With his head still spinning and eyes getting heavier, Barbarian drifts into a hazy, dark sleep.\n    He jolts awake as he hears the young woman causing a commotion. He can hear the loud cling of her handcuff as the guards unbind her and shove her onto the ground inside her cell. They slam the iron gate shut.\n    Barbarian, annoyed, closes his eyes again, and just as he is about to doze off, he hears the young woman whimper. He grunts and turns to his side, hoping to block out the sound.\n    The whimpering continues to get louder. Barbarian sighs and sits up. Without looking at the woman, he asks, “Are you okay?”\n    Her whimpering quiets down, and a heavy silence hangs between them, almost for a little too long. Barbarian debates whether to go back to sleep but hears her hoarsely say, “No, but I will be.”\n    Barbarian nods knowingly and turns to face her, asking, “What happened?\"\n    “I lost,” she says.\n    “First time?” Amused, Barbarian questions.\n    “No!” she sighs before continuing, “It was supposed to be my last fight before I am free from this place,” she counters with irritation.\n    Barbarian still can’t make out the details of her face but can see some green rocks embedded in what he assumes is her armor. Barbarian thinks to himself, Are those emeralds?\n    He snaps himself back into reality, saying, “Right.”\n    Barbarian feels a wave of dizziness come over him. He lies back down, staring blankly at the ceiling as the woman continues to talk.\n    “I just freaked out. I don’t know why, but I almost had it, but then suddenly… I felt this dread consume me. I have never felt anything like that, and I just froze. Like a block of ice. It was enough time for him to knock me out.”\n    Barbarian is still trying to brush off the dizziness and is caught off-guard by the confession.\n    The young woman picks up on his hesitation and continues, “I’m sorry for unloading. It’s just hard being trapped here…”\n    “It’s okay, I understand. It’s not exactly my first time being trapped like this either.” Barbarian manages to mumble a response.\n    She continues, “Well, how bad can another night in this cold dungeon be?\"\n    Barbarian doesn’t respond. He can sense her waiting for him to elaborate, but as the silence continues, he hopes she gets the hint and does not push for more.\n    In the quiet, Barbarian lets out a deep breath he wasn’t aware he was holding as he closes his eyes.\n    \n    \n<b>Chapter II:</b>\n    The heat is scorching high, burning Barbarian’s skin as the crowd cheers loudly. His opponent enters the arena. He is surprised to see a young woman with familiar bright white hair. He can now tell that the rocks he thought were emeralds embedded in her white armor are jade stones. Barbarian realizes he never learned her name, but his curiosity is quickly met as the arena master announces their names to the people.\n    As she starts stretching, Barbarian asks, “Jade?”\n    She chuckles and poses, “In the flesh!”\n    Barbarian is unsure what to expect from Jade as an opponent. He can see she is carrying a giant hammer adorned with her precious jade stones. He couldn’t tell much about her skills as a warrior from their conversations the night before, but looking at her, he could assume that Jade was a seasoned warrior.\n    The crowd is roaring. Barbarian takes a few long breaths and wipes the beads of sweat trickling down his forehead as he positions himself. He makes eye contact with Jade, who nods at him in acknowledgment as the fight starts.\n    The two stand, awaiting the other's opening move. Neither fighter is eager to make the first attack or the first mistake. Tired of the standoff, Barbarian makes the first move by swinging his sword. Jade dodges, but the weight of her great hammer comes at a cost to her speed.\n    She takes a massive leap with her hammer, aiming for his head; Barbarian manages to dodge the attack. Jade leaves him no time to recover as she attacks again. Anticipating the ferocious blow, Barbarian quickly dodges and swings his sword, grazing at Jade’s stomach.\n    Jade winces in pain as she takes several steps back to recover. Barbarian sees the opening and rushes to exploit his opponent's weakness but hesitates. He tries to tell himself that he barely knows her and that one cordial conversation doesn’t mean anything.\n    While Barbarian is busy contemplating, Jade seems to have recovered. She lets out a loud growl and starts to attack Barbarian repeatedly. Each time she slams her hammer down, she leaps closer and closer to him.\n    Barbarian is able to dodge the first couple of attacks, but eventually, he starts feeling the exhaustion of his movements. His actions become sloppier. He can see her open wound, but it doesn’t seem to slow her down.\n    Barbarian braces himself for another furious impact. Drained, he misses the dodge, and the hammer smashes onto his ankle. He winces in pain. Jade lets out a little giggle. Barbarian realizes he might lose the fight if he doesn’t match her energy.\n    He takes a deep breath and centers himself as he begins a new approach. Barbarian counters back every attack that Jade throws at him with ease. He feels confident again, the fire of battle burning in his chest.\n    However, the upper hand is short-lived as Jade swings her hammer sideways, a move she hasn’t used yet, and Barbarian is struck by the sweeping blow. He stumbles and fails to brace his fall.\n    Before he can collect himself, she swings her hammer down upon his head. Blood starts dripping down his face, and his vision blurs as he looks up at Jade, who is heaving.\n    The arena master calls the end of the match, declaring Jade the victor. She raises her hammer as the crowd chants her name. The last thing that Barbarian notices is the relief wash over Jade’s face as his eyes get heavier and he loses consciousness.\n    \n\n<b>Chapter III:</b>\n    The guards slam Barbarian’s body against his cell's cold, hard floor. The impact wakes him, but he decides to lay there until he hears the sound of the guard's boots fade away in the distance. Barbarian could tell that he was very disoriented as his vision blurred in and out. He touches his face and feels the dried blood that has caked everywhere.\n    He sits up, trying to piece together the events of the past couple of hours with some difficulty. Although he has lost many fights, he didn't consider the possibility of losing to Jade. He admits to himself that his ego is slightly bruised.  He wonders if the outcome would have been any different if he had not hesitated to exploit her weakness during the fight.\n    He looks at the empty cell beside his own and realizes he is alone. The other prisoners in the dungeon don’t seem friendly or interested in having a conversation. Even though he prefers solitude, he feels skeptical about surviving for too long without cordial human connection.\n    Barbarian gets up with some difficulty and walks towards the small, mucky sink in the corner of his cell. He splashes water on his face and stares at the bloody, red water swirling down the drain. He looks into the mirror and notices the swelling slowly creeping onto his face.\n    “I can do this,” he whispers to himself.","subtitle":"The Noble Savage","author":"Grishma","storyTitle":"In Solitude"},"renderImage":"rbxassetid://9166207628","kitItems":[{"featuredInKitSelection":true,"previewOnLobbyDisplayModel":true,"itemType":"rageblade","removeWhenDeactivatingKit":true}],"kitClass":0,"name":"Barbarian"},"harpoon":{"description":"An agile warrior with a Trident!

Upon this dreaded river of oaths lies a spire, dark castle partially obscured by gray, depressing clouds. The landscape around the structure is entirely desolate. This is where I reside. I am the Goddess Styx of the Greek Pantheon.\n    Per my routine, I drag my feet into the hall lit by fiery red hellfire pits. I take a seat on my throne of bones raised on a platform. The infinite hall is adorned with the skulls of every creature that has walked the world of the living. Large red pillars support the high arched ceiling covered with elaborate motifs of the devil himself. Every structural detail is a shade of blood red to honor the aesthetics of hell. The grand hall is gated by large, magnificent wooden doors to control the hoards of souls and avoid overcrowding.\n    Pale, translucent, tormented ghosts of people who refuse to pass on from the material world roam freely in this in-between realm. They haunt the halls with burning envy. The souls who just entered hell are queued up in thousands inside the hall and outside the gates. They cry in agony as they wait for their turn. The weight of their misfortune sags heavily on my shoulders. The destination of the souls’ everlasting torment is decided upon in this room, and I am its sole judge.\n    For centuries, I have been burdened with the responsibility of deciding the fate of which tier of hell each soul belongs to. The task is essential yet tedious. My ghouls and some minor demons assist me. The demons guard the room while the ghouls serve by following my beck and call.\n    A ghoul drags the first soul before me: a young woman guilty of stealing. Although a petty crime, it is still considered a deadly sin in the underworld. I am surprised to notice that, unlike the other unfortunate souls in the room, this woman seems unfazed by her fate. She stands proudly before me with her scrawny little shoulders squared up. Arrogant, I think to myself.\n    The ghoul urges the woman to state her case, which is usually my cue to drum my fingers on the arm of my throne and disassociate. I have heard these stories a million times, and nothing intrigues me anymore. A soul can commit only so many sins.\n    I notice the glimmer of resolution in the woman’s eyes as she refuses to beg for mercy. Instead, she proudly claims to have done it for her family's survival. Furthermore, she declares to have made peace with her eternal punishment.\n    I burst into laughter at her naivety. Groveling at my feet is her only chance of mercy. I rarely encounter souls like her who refuse to bend the knee. I admire their resolution, but eternal punishment in hell can break the bravest of souls. I smile as I pass my judgment with some hesitation. I send her to the seventh circle of hell, where she will spend the rest of eternity being trapped in a repeated cycle of torment for a sin she was forced to commit.\n    At moments like these, I realize how little power I wield. I do not think this woman deserves to be here, nor do I believe that my judgment of her crime is justified, but alas, I am a God, and yet I am a servant of hell.\n    My authority is limited. My job is not to decide if a soul deserves to be in hell, but it is to determine the place and the tools of the soul's damnation. Hell is a bureaucratic place, no different from the mortal world, and I am just a cog in its machine.\n    I watch as the demons guide the woman out of the hall and wonder if I could be as graceful as her if I were in her shoes. I hope she does not regret her impertinence, even though I am almost confident she will. The thought lingers in my mind for a fleeting moment before the next unfortunate soul is dragged in front of my eyesight as the vicious cycle of hell continues for another eternity.","subtitle":"The Weight of Power","author":"Grishma","storyTitle":"Sins of the Soul"},"battlepassSeason":"season10","unlockedInBattlePass":true,"difficulty":3,"priceRobux":399,"name":"Styx","gamepassId":1004335582,"bedCoinProduct":{"bedCoinProductId":44},"kitItems":[{"featuredInKitSelection":true,"itemType":"styx_entrance_portal","removeWhenDeactivatingKit":true}],"kitClass":3,"renderImage":"rbxassetid://17014536631"},"tinker":{"description":"Upgrade your Talos Mech to increase your shield and damage!

Everything you can lay your eyes on is covered with a thick layer of white snow. Our little camp lies next to the tree line of the forest grounds, tucked under the covers of tall bushes.\n    The chief, a wise, graying old woman of our tribe, has called an emergency meeting to discuss the next course of action. As I stand there shivering, surrounded by my family and friends, I observe our dwindling numbers. I realize how many lives we have lost to the great winter and how many families have been torn apart by nature's cruelty. I, too, have lost my younger sister and my father. A loss that seems to have broken my mother’s will.\n    The Chief proposes a contentious plan to abandon our current location in search of a warmer one, even though it is unlikely that we will find such a place. The members debate whether this desperate plan is even worth considering. The stakes are high either way, but this proposal has created a rift.\n    Desperate, a section of our tribe decides to part ways in hopes of finding a better future. With the few resources we have left, they start preparing for their deadly journey. I close my eyes and take a deep breath. I pray to some higher power to guide us in these harsh times.\n    As I slowly open my eyes and exhale, I notice that everyone at camp seems to be staring off in the distance. I turn my head to look at the spot and see a bright yellowish-orange silhouette of a figure emitting immense light and heat.\n    As the godly figure approaches the group, we are all engulfed in a warm hug. The heat pulsing off the figure is welcoming after the deadly cold we’ve endured for over a year. I look closer at the figure and notice that it has human-like features, yet there is nothing human about it.\n    Members of the tribe start backing away in fear. The chief takes this as her cue to confront the entity. “What… who are you?” she questions. The figure cocks their head to the side as if they’re amused. “I am Agni, the God of fire,” the entity responds.\n    “Fire?” the Chief asks again in confusion. The figure extends their palm out, and an orb of pulsing heat, like the sun, starts floating in it. The chief is startled but leans in to inspect the bright orb of light. She then reaches out her index finger to touch it, but Agni pulls their palm away.\n    “Careful, the fire will burn you. Let me demonstrate,” says Agni as they fling the ball toward the dead tree in the forest. The ball fizzles as it hits the dry trunk of a tree and sets it on fire. Soon enough, the whole forest is engulfed in red. The heat from the fire starts melting the snow around the area.\n    I have never seen such a magnificent view in my life, and judging by the expressions on the faces of my tribe members, neither have they. The crowd cheers as they bow to Agni. “Remember, fire is not only the bringer of life but also its destroyer,” Agni states before vanishing into the thin, smoky air, never to be reencountered.\n    Decades after this incident, the gift of fire kept evolving. It not only saved our tribe from extinction but also aided in our rapid growth and advancement. We went from being savage hunters and gatherers to building modern farming societies.

A large crowd of protestors is gathered at the gates, holding torches and chanting, “Free Officer Silas Blackwater!” at the top of their lungs. Tensions start rising as the crowd bursts through the gates, and the guards struggle to keep them at bay.\n    Zephyr passes by the mayhem of the guards dragging Officer Blackwater. He makes a beeline to the throne room, down a long hallway flanked by shiny marble pillars on both sides. He notices two figures sneaking around; he instantly recognizes them as high-ranking guild members as he sneaks around the pillars, searching for the right moment to strike.\n    Monk and Death Adder seem to be arguing, distracted enough that they don’t detect Zephyr’s presence. The argument turns sour as Monk faces away from Adder and starts kicking the sizeable solid wood double doors in an attempt to break them open.\n    Adder, annoyed and facing the door, commands Monk, “Stop! That will not work; it is some sort of magic!”\n    Adder walks towards Monk and shoves him to the side as she inspects the intricate locking system. Purple magical plasma starts floating around Adder’s hand. Zephyr takes this opportunity to surprise Monk by punching him across his face.\n    Unconscious, Monk’s body slams onto the marble floor with a thunk, causing Adder’s concentration to break and look toward the source of the sound.\n    Caught in action, Zephyr lunges towards Adder to rush her. Adder is quick to use her magic and knock Zephyr back. “Tsk, tsk, tsk. Look who’s here to save the day,” remarks Adder as she circles a winded Zephyr on the floor.\n    “How did you get in?” questions Zephyr as he gets off the floor. Adder laughs as she tries to strike Zephyr again but misses.\n    Zephyr, impatient, speaks up again, “What do you want, Adder? I am in the middle of something.”\n    “You know what I want. I want this kingdom to be free of its tyrannical ruler,” states Adder.\n    “Right, and you want this for the kingdom and not just for your gain?” questions Zephyr as he chuckles.\n    The moment is interrupted by a loud, gut-wrenching scream from inside the throne room. The pair look at each other in confusion. Zephyr rushes to the door and yanks the crystal tied around his neck. He uses it to unlock the door.\n    “Ah, should have thought about that,” remarks Adder as she gestures with her arms for Zephyr to proceed. Surprised by the lack of protest from Adder, Zephyr slams the door open.\n    The room is full of green smoke. The smoke slowly dissipates but still coats a thin layer inside the pair’s throats. Adder starts to cough aggressively, and Zephyr stifles a fit while covering his mouth. They carefully walk further into the room toward the throne.\n    “Father?” Zephyr calls out. No response.\n    Panicked, “FATHER?”\n    “Caw,” is all he hears in response.\n    Zephyr walks closer to the source of the sound and notices a raven perched on a pile of clothes between the crown's rims on the throne. It turns to look at Zephyr with wide eyes, “Caw, Caw!”\n    Zephyr is stunned, his mind reeling. He staggers backward and falls, unable to form a coherent thought. He stares at the raven, his next move uncertain.\n    Adder stifles her cough long enough to help Zephyr to his feet. She smirks at the scene before them and asks, “I wonder who could have done this?”\n    “Is that?” Zephyr's voice trails off, his eyes fixed on the raven.\n    \"Indeed, I guess there is a job vacancy,\" Adder states, her words hanging in the air, thick with anticipation.","subtitle":"Zephyr's Last Stand","author":"Grishma","storyTitle":"Fallen Kingdom"},"renderImage":"rbxassetid://9872355499","unlockedInBattlePass":true,"battlepassSeason":"season5","description":"Killing enemies gives you a stack of wind, decaying a short while after.

The room is large and circular. In the center, three identical thrones are raised on a pedestal. All across the room, billions of fragile, translucent threads hang from the ceiling, sparkling in the light from the tall, arched windows.\n    Each thread represents the life of one singular soul of all living things, including the Gods. These threads obscure all the minuscule details of the room while also exuding a ghostly light, faint yet beautiful.\n    The three Goddesses of Fate are perched on their thrones, holding shiny silver scissors. Although they are all blind, they are the only entities that can touch the threads and see the entirety of a soul's life.\n    I am filled with doubt as I kneel at the bottom of the thrones, waiting to receive my order. I wonder if they already know what my intentions are. ‘Fate works in mysterious ways’ has been reiterated for as long as I can remember.\n    The truth is that your fate is decided upon from the moment you are born. The illusion of free will is a mask to protect those holding the thread of your being, and after a couple of million years, the fates have forgotten their duty of being just judges of the soul.\n    I have watched this gradual change in their attitude. I have dared to question it a dozen times, but the Fates never seem to think of me as worthy of their words.\n    My time as a human has shaped my outlook as the Grim Reaper. I remember what it is like to love and to be loved. The suffering of the human soul is a concept that the Gods never truly understood or experienced. So, I decided to advocate for humankind once again before executing a perilous plan.\n    As I prepare to state my case, one of the fates, Lachese the Alloter, responsible for deciding the length of a soul’s life, gets up from her seat and reaches for a thread. “Do you know what soul this belongs to, Reaper?” she questions me.\n\tI am taken aback, as this is my first time hearing her voice. It is as if all three of them are speaking at once. Their familiar yet distant voices send a tingling sensation down my spine. The whispers of their voice echo in my mind even after she is done talking.\n    Cowardly, I shake my head to tell her I do not know. “It is yours! We have known that this day will come. It is the day of our doom and of your victory,” she says as she walks closer to me.\n    The Alloter ethereal air engulfs my being as she materializes an iron scythe out of thin air and hands it to me. “This is a God-killer. Take it!” she commands. I follow as instructed and hold the scythe in my hands as I feel the coldness of it spread through my body. I look at the Goddess’s blank, completely black eyes and ask, “Why? Why are you giving me this? If you can read my fate, you know I intend to end your reign.”\n\tThe Goddesses laugh unanimously as the Alloter answers, “Yes, child, we are aware. All things in nature come to an end, even Gods.” Confused, I countered by asking, “So, you’re just going to give up?”\n    The Goddess tilts her head as if my question amuses her, “You’re right. We are no longer fit to serve. To experience so much suffering all at once can be exhausting for even eternal beings like us. So, we wove in our demise with these threads of life.”\n    “So, what now?” I question, unsure of my next move.\n    “The lives of my sister and I are bound to these threads. If the threads cease to exist, then we do, too. You will assume our place and be the next judge of life and death without the interference of fate,” she states.\n    “Free will?” I inquire.\n    “Free will,” she confirms and continues. “So, are you ready?”","subtitle":"The God of Death","author":"Grishma","storyTitle":"Destined Threads"},"renderImage":"rbxassetid://9155467410","kitClass":0,"name":"Grim Reaper"},"davey":{"description":"Use a TNT Cannon to bombard your enemies.","bedCoinProduct":{"bedCoinProductId":9},"difficulty":3,"priceRobux":399,"gamepassId":20030035,"renderImage":"rbxassetid://9155464612","kitItems":[{"featuredInKitSelection":true,"itemType":"cannon","removeWhenDeactivatingKit":true},{"featuredInKitSelection":true,"itemType":"tnt","innateItem":{"firstSpawnOnly":true,"amount":1}}],"kitClass":4,"name":"Pirate Davey"},"infected_disruptor":{"difficulty":0,"disableKitRenting":true,"name":"Infected Disruptor","renderImage":"rbxassetid://11104063651","description":"🧟‍♂️","disableInLobby":true,"hiddenInShop":true},"infected_tank":{"difficulty":0,"disableKitRenting":true,"name":"Infected Tank","renderImage":"rbxassetid://11104063651","description":"🧟‍♂️","disableInLobby":true,"hiddenInShop":true},"warlock":{"description":"Drain health from enemies or sacrifice your health to heal allies.
